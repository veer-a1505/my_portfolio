              Hi, Iâ€™m veeramanikandan, and am based in Chennai. I am a commerce
              graduate. I was completed my UG in SRM arts and science college
              back in 2017.

              Then after a few months of job-hunting, I got an offer letter from
              TCS(Tata Consultancy Services). After 3+ years of experience as a
              process associate ( related to banking ), I've started to learn to
              code, cause of the incident that happened in my project which made
              me think about technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started to learn the basics of the web & computer science and
              how all concept works behind the scene. Then I started with Python
              Programming language which very high level and user-friendly for
              every beginner to programming.
